#### Introduction :
I am deeply passionate about designing and validating Software-Defined Radio (SDR)-based radio frequency (RF) simulators and wireless networks, and optimizing them using reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Over four years as an undergraduate lab-intern and during my M.S. degree at the _Smart Networking Lab_ in the Department of Computer Engineering at _Chosun University_, I developed expertise in wireless communications and RF-based object sensing.

My research journey continues as I join _HL Klemove_ in March 2025, contributing to the advancement of autonomous driving solutions.

(TMI) I am currently working at HL Klemove on an in-house CI/CD toolkit to improve the efficiency of ADAS Radar research processes.

#### Research Experience 1 (During M.S. degree):
Wireless technology has achieved remarkable advancements in frequency performance, yet these gains come with increased energy consumption and computational complexity. To address these challenges, my work focuses on leveraging RL to optimize wireless resource allocation while balancing trade-offs between spectral and energy efficiency. Specifically, I designed the multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithm for massive antenna-aided base station (BS) transmission power allocation in multi-cellular networks. This work was published in _IEEE Access_ and received the Best Paper Award at the _33rd Joint Conference on Communications and Information (JCCI)_.

#### Research Experience 2 (During B.S. degree) : 
I designed and validated RF simulators and SDR-based RF transceivers, incorporating multi-hop routing algorithms, TDD/TDMA, OFDM, and MIMO systems using digital signal processing techniques. These efforts led to nine research papers presented at international and domestic conferences, one of which received the Best Paper Award at _the 2021 Winter Conference of the Korea Information and Communications Society (KICS)_.
