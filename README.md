#### Introduction:
Mostly interested in multimodal AI, reinforcement learning-based optimization, RF sensing, and 5G/B5G. Also working for applications of smart solutions (integrated IoT/ICT with deep neural nets) in computer vision and wireless communication.
___

#### Recent projects:
Lately leading a lab project as "multimodal AI-based human mobility detection, tracking, and motion estimation". The suggested idea is to utilize WiFi signal characteristics to improve camera-based detection and tracking performance. In addition, responsible for newly multimodal and DL/ML algorithms to apply our proposed approach.
